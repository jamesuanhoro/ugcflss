ugcflss performs unadjusted group comparisons for data that are sum scores of
of several Likert items, and produces plots that help describe patterns in the
data. Models rely on Bayesian regularization and hierarchical ordinal regression.
Regularization and hierarchical modeling help with stabilizing model parameters
and inference about quantities of interest. Ordinal regression helps with
describing the distribution of the data accurately.
